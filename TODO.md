# Transcription style

I should probably try to adhere to later styles of transcription rather
than the earlier ones. A good example would be the [GRZLOG1 transcription](http://mizar.org/fm/2015-23/pdf23-3/grzlog_1.pdf)
and [Mizar article](http://mizar.org/version/current/html/grzlog_1.html).

This will require re-thinking how I am writing up theorems, I'll
probably need to use an `enumerate` environment.

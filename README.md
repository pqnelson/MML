This is a "parallel" text of the Mizar Mathematical Library, as ordered
by `mml.lar` using the abstracts available in Mizar version 8.1.12. I
got this idea from Sebastian Koch's [introduction to the MML](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2806593/31693).

The left-hand side is text based on the transcripts of the journal
_Formalized Mathematics_ (but for older texts, I have revised the
article to match the content of the abstracts). The right-hand side is
the code from the abstract for a Mizar article.

If you clone this git repo, just run `make` to produce a PDF using PDF-LaTeX,
the `paracolumn` package, `amsbook`, and a few other standard latex
packages.

I'm probably going to try to write a Python script to speed up
transcribing Mizar abstracts to parallel text.
